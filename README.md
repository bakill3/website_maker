**WebSite Maker is an innovative platform designed to generate fully-customizable websites, similar to WordPress. This project is the result of intensive two weeks of work during my internship, showcasing my ability to work effectively under tight deadlines.**

## **Core Features:**

### **User Authentication:**
  - Facilitates secure user access via a login mechanism.

### **Create Website:**
  - Users can create unique websites by choosing the commercial activity, selecting the preferred template, and picking the desired sections for their website such as 'About Us', 'Map', etc.

#### Website Maker offers wide-ranging editing capabilities for tailor-made website design: ####

- **Project Title:** Users can customize the project title to reflect the brand or purpose of the website.
- **Main CSS:** Allows changes to the main CSS to redefine the overall look and feel of the website.
- **Typography Control:** Users have control over the font size and color for different heading types (H1 to H6).
- **Section Customization:** Each section of the website (like 'About Us', 'Map', etc.) can be personalized with a unique title, description, and specific CSS.
- **Map Customization:** Users can specify the latitude and longitude for the Map section, thereby customizing the map to reflect the desired location.
