# WebSite Maker
This is a website that generates websites (like wordpress). I made this project in 2 weeks with deadline in my internship;

  - Create project/website (choose comercial activity, the template, the desired sections for your website [about, map] and you're ready     to go);
  - Edit Project:
    - Title of the project;
    - Main CSS;
    - Color and font-size of H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6;
    - Title of the section;
    - Description of the section;
    - CSS of the section;
    - Latitude & Longitude of the Map;
    - Delete/Update default images from the template;
